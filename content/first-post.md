# The beginning!

This is my first blog post! Excited to get started. I've always wanted to have a nice, small blog where I can share my (albeit filtered) thoughts and ideas. My pitch that pretty much describes who I am and what I do is below.

> I'm a passionate developer with a knack for solving problems! My experience across Expedia Group, Microsoft, and Walmart has made me a versatile developer, comfortable in backend, frontend, fullstack, and even cloud engineering. I code in languages like Java, Python, and C++, and I'm well-versed in frameworks like Spring Boot and React. Plus, I hold certifications in Azure cloud architecture, making me a strong asset for any team looking to build and innovate. I like to tinker and try things out during my free time. I have a raspberry pi that I put to use often and several ideas that I try to execute when curiosity strikes.
