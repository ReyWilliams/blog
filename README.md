# Sharing Thoughts :thinking: and Ideas :thought_balloon:!

This repo hosts my blog which is generated with [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/index.html) - a static site generator that is written in Python! This branch (`writing`) is used to update my blog entries. Changes here will be built and published by a GitHub Action that acts as CI/CD.
